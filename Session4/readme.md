# Architectural Basics

## Image Normalization,
## 3x3 Convolutions,
## Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
## How many layers,
## Receptive Field,
## Position of MaxPooling,
## MaxPooling,
## 1x1 Convolutions,
## Batch Normalization,
## Concept of Transition Layers,
## Position of Transition Layer,
## The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
## The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
## SoftMax,
## Adam vs SGD
## When to add validation checks
## How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
## When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
## DropOut
## Batch Size, and effects of batch size
## LR schedule and concept behind it
## Learning Rate,
## Number of Epochs and when to increase them,
